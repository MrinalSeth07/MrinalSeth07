# 👋 Hey, I'm Mrinal Seth  

> *A struggler developer — not the best, not the worst — just someone trying to figure it out, one commit at a time.*

### 🌱 About Me
- 💻 Interested in **manipulation & formation** — bending logic, shaping code, creating something out of nothing.  
- 🔍 Still exploring my path, not fully guided, but always learning.  
- ⚡ Believe in **hard work over shortcuts**.  
- 🧠 Not claiming a "great mind", but definitely a *good one* that doesn’t give up.  

---

### 🛠️ Tech Spirit
I tinker with:
- Programming concepts (still leveling up 🚀)  
- Building things that may not be perfect, but are *mine*.  
- Breaking → Fixing → Learning → Repeating.  

---

### 🎯 Goals
- Keep pushing through the struggle.  
- Write code that *works* (and maybe looks cool someday).  
- Grow into a developer who can inspire the next struggler.
