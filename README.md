### 🌱 About Me
- 💻 Interested in **manipulation & formation** — bending logic, shaping code, creating something out of nothing.  
- 🔍 Still exploring my path, not fully guided, but always learning.  
- ⚡ Believe in **hard work over shortcuts**.  
- 🧠 Not claiming a "great mind", but definitely a *good one* that doesn’t give up.
